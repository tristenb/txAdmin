            This is an experiment to test the database engine required for a player logging system. <br>
            If this test works this will be implemented as a core feature of <strong>txAdmin</strong>, as well as a
            <strong>warn</strong> and <strong>whitelist</strong> system. <br>
            We cannot guarantee neither its functionality nor the persistence of the database, that's why a player list
            export feature is provided. <br>

            After enabling this experiment a server restart is required. <br>
            You can disable this anytime you want. <br>
